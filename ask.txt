Write the code that uses state-of-the-art machine learning methods applicable to the optimal therapy process problem is Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular Q-Learning. Q-Learning aims to solve problems in which a model has to choose among a series of options to maximize a certain goal in the given situation: the model observes a set of actions and the outcome these actions have, thus learning which choices are optimal and which are not. Q-Learning is thus a type of machine learning, an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
use Q-Learning to find a treatment policy that maximizes positive patient outcomes, defined as a linear combination of multiple outcomes, e.g., DFS, RFS, and survival outcomes, with different physician specified weights. Specifically, apply Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to determine the optimal treatment sequence for the curated dataset of breast cancer patients. The dataset includes 4 decision points for each patient, related to (1) surgery, (2) chemotherapy, (3) hormone therapy, and (4) radiotherapy, treatment. The resulting fitted models (should vary in depth from linear to 9-layer neural networks) and be evaluated on a separate test set of patients, by assessing the similarity to real-life doctors’ decisions, as well as by predicting the outcome of the dynamic treatment choices through a separate model built to simulate the effect of treatment decisions based on the patient’s history.
consider 4 treatment decision points for each patient as part of the treatment policy. preprocess the data as is the norm for training neural networks, handle classes imbalances, drop or change columns, rescale features, as the preprocessing steps would require. Traditional Q-learning algorithms require that the models interact with the environment during training, applying a trial-and-error strategy. This is of course not feasible in a dynamic treatment problem, as it would involve the treatment of real people following the directions of a not yet optimal model, which would be problematic both for ethical reasons and time constraints (if the model needs to treat each patient from beginning to post-treatment follow-up it would take decades for the model to be completely trained). construct the models following the same Q-learning algorithm presented by Moodie et al. [3], in which allows the models to learn from observational data by revisiting the Reinforcement Learning problem as a Supervised Learning problem: for the last treatment decision, the Q-function is the function that maps history and final decision to the final outcome (either Overall Survival or the combined outcome as specified above): the RL problem is thus translated to learning the relationship between patient history, treatment decision. The training is then carried out as in any other regression problem, with a dataset of patients and backpropagation between each epoch, until convergence. There is no need for episodes or rewards, as would be the case with an interactive RL algorithm. For the intermediate decisions, the training is done recursively by using as the variable to predict the Q value computed by the model of the following decision.
implemented DQL to model the dynamic decision process at the 4 distinct treatment decision points. A separate neural network model is to be trained for each of the 4 decision points respectively, each model being constructed recursively based on the results of the model representing the subsequent decision point . The features included at each decision point represent the complete history of the patient up to the current treatment decision.the learning approach should construct multiple shallow-to-deep neural networks (with a number of layers varying from 0 to 9), as a linear model would not be able to adequately capture the problem complexity and optimally solve it. For each category of models, construct a series of increasingly deeper NNs, starting from a 0-layer linear model and progressively adding layers, until the deepest model showed poor performance on the training set (due to overfitting). To estimate the statistics of our results, you can sample separate training sets from the initial training data, and train a separate model on each of these sets, thus obtaining bootstrapped models. the bootstrapping in that case should allow you to give more precise results by providing 95% confidence intervals. construct and train the models using the PyTorch framework with GPU acceleration. the goal of DQL is not to replicate doctors’ decisions, but to find an optimal treatment, which may differ from what the physician prescribed, your evaluation should include building a separate model which, given a patient’s history and the prescribed treatment, predicts the outcome of that treatment. This patient treatment digital twin approach should enable you to simulate the results of applying the Q-Learning models to patients, and compare the outcomes to the repository recorded outcomes resulting from the clinicians’ decisions. so theTreatment Simulator you will build should, be based on the patient’s history and treatment decisions, predicts the outcome at the next step. The simulator should contain a separate model for each intermediate and final outcome measure, built using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and tuned via 5-fold cross-validation over the training data to select the best kernel (between gaussian, sigmoid, or polynomial) and hyperparameters. These models could serve as an in silico digital twin of the patient treatment, as you can use them to dynamically simulate the patient’s in vivo course as a function given treatment policy, without physically having to treat the patient. The prediction accuracy of the TS with 95% confidence intervals should be assessed with out of bag evaluation of models trained on stratified bootstrapped samples. note that although many RL algorithms learn by applying the policy in an environment, do not use the TS in the training phase, and only limit its use to evaluation. This approach, based on learning from observation data, enables us to avoid the risk of overfitting the DQL models to the simulated environment. This results in a more objective evaluation of the learned DQL models. The TS performance was also evaluated at the whole policy level by comparing its final outcome prediction against the recorded final outcomes, when the TS followed the same policy as the one prescribed by the physicians, for each patient in the test dataset. Using the TS, we can then compare the outcomes yielded by the DQL decisions with those yielded by the physicians’ prescriptions, thus evaluating the DQL effectiveness. Furthermore, to objectively compare the DQL decisions to the physicians’ decisions and facilitate interpretation, we compute the similarity between each DQL model’s decisions and the physicians’ decisions, considering each decision point independently, and without inclusion of the treatment simulator (TS). To this end, at each decision point, compute the percentage of patients (train or test) for which the DQL model made the same decision as the physicians at that decision point, regardless of what the previous decision(s) were. compute an overall similarity score averaging the similarity for each decision point for each model. evaluate the treatment decisions made by the Q-learning models by examining compliance with the NCCN guidelines of acceptable care . do not introduce the guidelines/restrictions during model training. To further support interpretation, analyze the general policy followed by each of the Q-learning models by computing the increase (or decrease) in prescription rate for each treatment decision compared to the physicians’ ad-hoc prescriptions, to express whether each model is more (or less) likely to prescribe a certain treatment when compared to the actual physician. All evaluations should be performed on a separate test set of patients.
